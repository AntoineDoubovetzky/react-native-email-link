# React Native Email Link

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/includable/react-native-email-link.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

An easy way to open an email app of the user's choice, based on the apps they have installed
on their device.

Currently supported apps:

* Apple Mail
* Gmail
* Inbox
* Spark
* Airmail
* Outlook


## Installation

```
npm i -S react-native-email-link         # or yarn add react-native-email-link
```

### A note about iOS 9+
As of iOS 9, your app needs to provide the `LSApplicationQueriesSchemes` key inside
Info.plist to specify the URL schemes with which the app can interact.

Just put this in your Info.plist depending on which apps you'd like to support.
Omitting these might mean that the library can't detect some of the mail apps installed by the user.

```
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
    <string>message</string>
    <string>readdle-spark</string>
    <string>airmail</string>
    <string>ms-outlook</string>
    <string>googlegmail</string>
    <string>inbox-gmail</string>
</array>
```

## Usage

```
import { openInbox } from 'react-native-email-link'

openInbox()
```
